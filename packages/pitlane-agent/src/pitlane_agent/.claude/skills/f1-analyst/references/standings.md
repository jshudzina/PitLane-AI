# Standings Analysis

Analyze championship standings, driver/constructor performance across the season, and title fight scenarios.

## Planned Analysis Types

The following standings analysis types are planned for future implementation:

### 1. Championship Possibilities
**What it would do:**
- Calculate which drivers can still mathematically win the World Drivers' Championship
- Determine points required for championship
- Show theoretical scenarios for title contention

**Example Questions:**
- "Who can still win the drivers' championship?"
- "How many points does Norris need to catch Verstappen?"
- "Is the constructors' championship still possible for Ferrari?"

### 2. Driver Standings Heatmap
**What it would do:**
- Visualize driver standings evolution throughout the season
- Show position changes race-by-race in a heatmap format
- Highlight performance trends across the calendar

**Example Questions:**
- "Show me how the championship battle has evolved this season"
- "Visualize the top 10 standings progression"
- "How has McLaren's position changed throughout the year?"

### 3. Season Summary Visualization
**What it would do:**
- Provide comprehensive overview of the entire season
- Aggregate performance metrics for drivers and teams
- Visualize points distribution and race wins

**Example Questions:**
- "Give me a season summary for 2024"
- "Show me overall performance statistics for this year"
- "Compare drivers' full season results"

## Implementation Status

**Status:** Not yet implemented in PitLane CLI

These analysis types require new PitLane CLI commands. Once implemented, this file will be updated with:
- Specific command syntax
- Parameter details
- Analysis workflow
- Response formatting guidelines
- Example analyses

## Temporary Workaround

Until these commands are available, you can:
1. Direct users to the official F1 website or FastF1 documentation for standings information
2. Explain that standings analysis is planned but not yet available
3. Suggest they use other analysis types (lap times, strategy) in the meantime
